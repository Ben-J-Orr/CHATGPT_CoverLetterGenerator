Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Settlements Administrator role at your leading UK Wealth Management company. With my extensive experience in managing multimillion-dollar budgets and global staffs, as well as my skills in managing administrative tasks, I am confident that I am the ideal candidate for this role.

As a Global Supply Chain Executive, I have successfully executed supply chain strategies for consumer/retail brands while managing budgets and staffs of 100+. I am a change agent who has reorganized and integrated supply chain functions at three global companies. I have also led multi-national teams, optimizing the match of supply and demand during periods of high volatility and growth in various sales channels.

In my previous roles, I have gained experience in settling trades within specified market deadlines, processing market trades in different platforms, and reconciling market/internal accounts. I am familiar with BONY, Euroclear, DTC, Global, and other settlement platforms. I am also skilled in providing support in a busy team environment, understanding the pressures of running a leading operations function, and using PC tools, including Excel and Word.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn all aspects of international settlement and provide assistance to the International Settlements Department. Moreover, I am flexible with working hours and keen on working in a hybrid environment after the 3-month probation period.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further.

Sincerely,

James King
