Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the IT Infrastructure Technician position at the UK's leading Diagnostic Medical Pathology organisation in Central London. With my experience in managing IT helpdesk tickets and configuring new hardware, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role.

I have over 12 years of experience in the IT industry, including five years in a similar role managing hardware and software for a multi-national corporation. My ability to troubleshoot user issues, perform upgrades, and arrange repairs will allow me to maintain the existing IT infrastructure while deploying and configuring new IT Windows hardware.

I am also skilled in active directory user management, administering email systems, and regularly performing system patching and maintenance. In addition, my background in legal research and writing, as well as my experience leading cross-functional teams, makes me a strong candidate for documenting all areas of responsibility and working on IT infrastructure projects as required.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your company further.

Sincerely,
James King
